Project Overview:
  This project is a mobile app that is meant to facilitate studying using the old flashcards method; the user can create multiple decks of cards, each deck could belong to a studying topic, they can then add unlimited number of cards inside each deck.

  A card content is basically the question and its corresponding answer that remains hidden until the user chooses to see the answer. If the answer shown matches what the user has answered, they can mark the question as correct and vice versa.

  Once the user has gone through the last question in the deck, they are shown their score, indicating the percentage of correct answers, this way, they user can keep track of his knowledge about a certain topic, and determine whether they need to brush up on the topic.


Running the app:
  - navigate into 'flashcards' and run "npm install"
  - after the app has finished installing, run "npm start"
  - Your app should be up and running now, choose a deck from the already present list of decks and take a quiz, or feel free to create your own decks and quzzes. Have fun with it :)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React  Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
